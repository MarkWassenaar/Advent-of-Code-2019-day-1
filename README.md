Advent of Code 2019

Day 1 - Part 1

Plan:

1. Calculate the fuel per module.
2. Run the calculation over the entire array of modules.
3. Show the result.

Blocks:

1. I had to look up the best way to round down. I found that Math.floor did the trick just perfectly and used it.
2. I wanted to use a for-loop first to go through the array, but I remembered the better menthod of reduce. I had to look up the syntax for this before using it.
